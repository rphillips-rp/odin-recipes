    <p><strong>This is a Pad Thai recipe that truly stacks up to great Thai restaurants, yet is totally doable for every home cook with just a trip to your every day grocery store.</strong></p>
    <p>Authentic Pad Thai on the streets of Thailand has a distinct fishy/prawny “funk” (which sounds thoroughly unappetising but is actually completely addictive and the very essence of true Thai street food). If authentic is what you're after, try this Prawn/Shrimp version</p>
    <p>This recipe serves 2-3 people and will take approximately 20 minutes in prep time and 10 minutes to cook.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <ul>Sauce:
            <li>125g of Pad Thai dried rice sticks</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp tamarind puree (not concentrate)</li>
            <li>3 tbsp packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <li>2-3 tbsp vegetable or canola oil</li>
        <li>Half an onion</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>150g chicken breast or thigh (thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1.5 cups of beansprouts</li>
        <li>0.5 cup of firm tofu, cut into 3cm batons</li>
        <li>0.25 cup of garlic chives, cut into 3cm pieces</li>
        <li>0.25 cup finely chopped peanuts</li>
        <li> For serving you can add lemon wedges, ground chilli or cayenne pepper and/or beansprouts</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place noodles in a large bowl, pour over plenty of boiling water. Soak for 5 minutes, then drain in a colander and quickly rinse under cold water. Don't leave them sitting around for more than 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix Sauce in small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large non stick pan (or well seasoned skillet) over high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and cook for 1 1/2 minutes until mostly cooked through.</li>
        <li>Push to one side of the pan, pour egg in on the other side. Scramble using the wooden spoon (add touch of extra oil if pan is too dry), then mix into chicken.</li>
        <li>Add bean sprouts, tofu, noodles and then the sauce.</li>
        <li>Toss gently for about 1 1/2 minutes until Sauce is absorbed by the noodles.</li>
        <li>Add garlic chives and half the peanuts. Toss through quickly then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, sprinkled with remaining peanuts and lime wedges on the side, with a sprinkle of chilli and a handful of extra beansprouts on the side if desired (this is the Thai way!). Squeeze over lime juice to taste before eating.</li>
    </ol>
